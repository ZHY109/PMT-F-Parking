# PMT-F-Parking

This is the official code repository for the paper "PMT-F: Preparation and Multi-stage Training with Field Reward for Autonomous Valet Parking". It implements two reinforcement learning parking environments (Parallel Parking and Perpendicular Parking), two reinforcement learning reward algorithms (Field Reward, Simple Reward), and six reinforcement learning algorithms (PMT-F, PMT-S, SPST-F, SPST-S, DT-F, DT-S). 

The paper introduces an efficient autonomous parking algorithm based on preparation, multi-stage training, and field reward function, PMT-F, achieving success rates of 91.4% in perpendicular parking and 100% in parallel parking.
